# Task: Hierarchical BVH for mesh intersection, GLTF, and `CombineMesh`

## Why

The existing spatial index answers the inexpensive question, “which
renderable bounds might this ray hit?”  It is a scene-level BVH over ECS
`RenderableComponent` AABBs.  It is deliberately not a triangle-intersection
acceleration structure.

That distinction was easy to overlook while scenes contained mostly simple
primitives.  It becomes necessary to make explicit for two cases now in
scope:

- a GLTF anime/avatar model can contain roughly 50,000–100,000 triangles
  across its primitives (and substantially more in more detailed assets);
- `CombineMesh {}` creates a new, potentially large, baked mesh and the
  default mode removes its source renderables, so the result no longer has a
  per-source entry in the current ECS BVH.

Testing every triangle in every candidate model after a scene-BVH hit would
turn selection and ray casts into an unacceptable linear scan.  An aggregate
`CombineMesh` bounds box alone fixes neither accurate picking nor selection
ownership.  The engine needs two levels of acceleration rather than one
recursive BVH that conflates scene instances and mesh triangles.

## Existing seams

- `BvhSystem` stores `RenderableAabb` shapes keyed by `ComponentId`, builds a
  BVH with the `bvh` crate, and exposes
  `raycast_renderables_candidates(...)`.  Its unit of indexing is an ECS
  renderable's world-space AABB.
- `RayCastSystem` asks that BVH for candidates and then runs a narrow-phase
  policy.  Its current generic fallback is bounds-oriented; it does not own a
  reusable arbitrary-triangle acceleration structure.
- `CpuMesh` (`src/engine/graphics/mesh.rs`) retains positions, normals, and
  `indices_u32`, providing the local-space triangles needed to build an
  immutable mesh BVH.
- GLTF import produces CPU meshes from primitives.  Skinning is a separate
  concern: the rendered vertices may be in a current animated pose rather
  than the static CPU mesh pose.
- `CombineMeshSystem` bakes descendant `CpuMesh` data into one output mesh,
  uses the first material for phase 1, and registers that output directly in
  `VisualWorld`.  In default mode it removes the source subtree.  The output
  presently has no `RenderableComponent`/`BoundsComponent` registration, so
  it is absent from `BvhSystem`, ray selection, and editor show-bounds.

## Target model: two-level traversal

Call this a *hierarchical BVH* in engine-facing documentation, but preserve
the ownership boundary between the two levels:

```text
ray in world space
  -> scene/instance BVH (dynamic world AABBs)
       -> renderable, GLTF primitive, or CombineMesh aggregate instance
            -> transform ray into that mesh's local space
                 -> cached mesh triangle BVH (local triangles)
                      -> triangle hit + barycentrics/normal
  -> resolve hit to authored owner and editor selection target
```

### Scene / instance BVH

Keep a dynamic top-level BVH over *pickable instances*.  An instance has a
world AABB, a world/local transform, an optional material/visibility policy,
and a stable selection owner.  It should support refitting when only its
world transform changes and rebuilding when instances are added or removed.

The current `BvhSystem` is the natural starting seam, but its API and data
model must no longer assume “instance equals `RenderableComponent`.”  Define
an explicit instance record/handle so a collapsed `CombineMesh` output and a
normal ECS renderable participate equally without fabricating ghost authored
renderables.

### Mesh triangle BVH

Build one immutable local-space triangle BVH per CPU mesh revision, cached by
the mesh asset/handle plus a content revision.  It contains triangle index
ranges and local AABBs, not world transforms.  Every instance of the same
mesh shares it.

After the broad phase, transform the ray once by the candidate's inverse
world matrix and traverse this local tree.  Convert the winning distance and
normal back consistently to world space.  This avoids rebuilding a triangle
tree for each duplicate/instance and avoids transforming tens of thousands of
triangles per ray.

For large GLTF primitives this is the critical scaling boundary: a ray should
visit a small hierarchy of local node bounds and only a small number of leaf
triangles, rather than linearly inspecting 50k–100k triangles.

## `CombineMesh` policy

### Phase 1 output registration

Give each successful combined output one top-level pickable instance with:

- aggregate local bounds from the baked `CpuMesh`;
- the outer `CombineMesh` transform as its world transform;
- the baked mesh's cached triangle BVH;
- selection ownership resolving to the `CombineMesh` component or its
  authored outer transform, not to deleted source nodes.

This makes default-collapse trusses clickable and gives Editor Settings “show
bounds” exactly one meaningful aggregate box.  The registration should be
owned by `CombineMeshSystem`/the spatial system and removed or replaced in
the same lifecycle transaction as the VisualWorld output.  It must not depend
on a dummy `RenderableComponent` solely to enter the BVH.

### `keep_transforms()` provenance

The baked mesh needs a triangle-range provenance table in addition to its
triangle BVH:

```text
baked triangle range -> source component / source mesh handle / source triangle range
```

With this mode, select the aggregate by default but retain enough information
to offer deliberate source-level selection, inspection, or debugging later.
The policy must be explicit: source transform editing causes rebake, and any
stale output spatial entry is replaced atomically after the new bake.

Default collapsed mode may discard that table after choosing a stable owner,
unless future tooling requires source attribution after collapse.

## Animated and skinned GLTF policy

The static local mesh BVH above is correct for rigid meshes.  It is not by
itself exact for skinned vertices: a triangle's current pose can move relative
to the bind-pose tree every animation frame.

Before implementing skinned `CombineMesh`, choose and document one of these
policies (or a staged combination):

1. **Current-pose CPU snapshot:** evaluate/sketch the current skinned
   vertices, build or refit a per-pose triangle BVH, and use that snapshot for
   exact CPU ray hits.  This is the most direct compatibility path for phase
   2 CombineMesh baking, but needs memory, revision, and update-budget limits.
2. **Coarse skinned bounds then exact snapshot on demand:** maintain
   conservative broad-phase bounds per skinned primitive; only snapshot and
   traverse detailed geometry for candidates.  This may be the practical
   default for avatars.
3. **Renderer-assisted picking:** use an ID/depth pass for rendered-surface
   picking, while retaining CPU BVHs for physics, pointers, and non-rendered
   ray queries.  Define differences in occlusion and latency clearly.

Do not treat a bind-pose mesh BVH as exact animated intersection.  If it is
temporarily used as a broad phase, label the resulting picking approximation
and provide a conservative/current-pose fallback.

## Work plan

### A. Define common spatial instance and hit types

- Introduce `SpatialInstance` (or equivalent) independent of ECS
  `RenderableComponent`, with bounds, transform, mesh reference, visibility,
  and owner/selection routing.
- Extend the ray result beyond `(ComponentId, distance)` to carry instance
  identity, triangle index, barycentric coordinates, world normal, and the
  resolved authored owner as appropriate.
- Preserve existing UI raycast priority and `RaycastableComponent` rules;
  mesh intersection belongs only to the relevant 3D branch.

### B. Implement and cache local triangle BVHs

- Choose a robust triangle BVH builder/traverser (the existing crate if it
  supports this cleanly, otherwise a mesh-specialized implementation).
- Cache by immutable `CpuMesh` asset revision; invalidate when a generated
  combined mesh is replaced or an editable mesh changes.
- Define degenerate-triangle, missing-index, non-invertible-transform,
  back-face, and max-distance behavior.
- Add cache counters and timing seams so the future Engine Stats panel can
  report mesh-BVH count, triangle count, cache memory, build/refit work, and
  ray traversal candidates.

### C. Register normal, GLTF, and CombineMesh instances

- Migrate normal renderable registration into the common spatial-instance
  path without breaking current bounds/refit behavior.
- Register each collapsed `CombineMesh` output as one aggregate instance;
  update/remove it with output lifecycle and expose its aggregate bounds to
  the editor.
- For `keep_transforms()`, define whether only the aggregate is raycastable
  (recommended initially) or source instances are separately selectable;
  never permit duplicate hits accidentally.
- Use GLTF primitive boundaries where useful for culling/material ownership,
  while still sharing a mesh BVH for repeated mesh assets.

### D. Add skinned snapshot policy and budgets

- Establish snapshot ownership/lifetime, update cadence, maximum triangles,
  and what happens when a budget is exceeded.
- Ensure a CombineMesh bake of skinned descendants explicitly consumes a
  current-pose snapshot, records its pose/revision, and does not silently bake
  bind-pose geometry.
- Benchmark a representative 50k–100k triangle animated avatar as both a
  normal GLTF scene and a CombineMesh source.

## Acceptance criteria

- A ray can pick a collapsed truss through one aggregate spatial instance;
  the hit resolves to its CombineMesh/outer authored owner and show-bounds
  displays the same aggregate bounds.
- Repeated rigid mesh instances share one local triangle BVH, while their
  transforms remain independent top-level instances.
- A large static GLTF primitive is triangle-tested through a local BVH, not a
  full triangle scan per candidate ray.
- Replacing/rebaking a CombineMesh neither leaks its old VisualWorld/spatial
  entry nor creates duplicate hits.
- Skinned mesh intersection has a documented current-pose accuracy policy;
  bind-pose BVHs are never represented as exact animated hits.
- Tests cover nearest-hit ordering, transformed/non-uniformly scaled meshes,
  aggregate bounds, owner resolution, stale-output removal, and shared-cache
  reuse.  Add benchmark coverage for the representative avatar and combined
  truss scenes.
