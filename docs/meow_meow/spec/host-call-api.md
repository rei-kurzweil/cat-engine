# ૮ ˙Ⱉ˙ ა Host API

Status: target architecture

The host API is the typed, host-neutral effect boundary owned by
`meow-meow-script`. Its ownership and lifetime rules are normative in
[Mittens host and MMS runtime boundary](mittens-host-and-runtime-boundary.md).

No `World`, `RxWorld`, `ComponentId`, render-asset handle, intent, or other
engine type crosses this boundary.

## Two layers

The API has two related layers:

1. `HostRequest` and `HostResponse` describe one engine operation.
2. The worker protocol correlates that operation with the persistent MMS
   session operation that requested it.

A direct embedding may implement the synchronous host trait:

```rust
pub trait Host {
    fn dispatch_with_context(
        &mut self,
        context: &mut HostContext,
        request: HostRequest,
    ) -> Result<HostResponse, HostError>;
}
```

The host does not advertise a second `HostCapabilities` schema. Its operation
bindings are attached while Mittens builds the one `RuntimeSpec`; construction
fails unless every host-effectful declaration has exactly one binding.

A **host-effectful declaration** is a `RuntimeSpec` vocabulary declaration
whose implementation crosses the MMS host boundary. This distinguishes it
from pure crate-implemented declarations and from deferred callback execution,
which may evaluate multiple pure and host-effectful calls over its lifetime.

Mittens uses the worker form because its evaluator state persists off the main
thread while `World` and related services must remain on it:

```text
worker                                      main thread
──────                                      ───────────
HostRequest {
  operation_id,
  request_id,
  request,
} ────────────────────────────────────────► short-lived MittensHost::dispatch

HostResponse {
  operation_id,
  request_id,
  result,
} ◄──────────────────────────────────────── same session operation resumes
```

Queue/channel selection is an embedding detail. The correlation fields and
validation behavior are not.

## Correlation rules

- Operation IDs identify source evaluations, export calls, callback calls, or
  REPL operations.
- Request IDs identify host calls within an operation.
- A response must echo both IDs.
- The worker rejects stale, duplicate, unknown, or mismatched responses.
- A completed, timed-out, reset, or cancelled operation cannot later consume a
  response.
- Every accepted host request produces exactly one response, including
  failures, so evaluation cannot deadlock waiting for an error path.

The legacy engine-local `EvalRequest`/`EvalResponse` ring buffer is superseded
by this crate-owned protocol and is not a compatibility surface.

## Values and identities

Requests and responses contain only crate-owned DTOs.

- Scalar transport values are owned.
- Tables or arrays crossing as transport values are snapshots unless the
  operation explicitly returns a session-owned value.
- `ComponentHandle` is an opaque identity for a host-owned ECS object.
- `CallbackHandle` is an opaque identity for a closure retained by the MMS
  session.
- `MaterializedCE` is an evaluated component-tree DTO, not an AST evaluation
  request.

A raw closure/function `Value` must not be sent to or stored by the engine.
Handler registration carries an opaque callback reference associated with its
originating session.

## Required request families

Exact Rust variant names may evolve, but the public protocol must represent
these operations without engine types.

| Family | Request data | Response |
|---|---|---|
| Source loading | importer identity, import specifier | resolved identity and source text |
| Component construction | evaluated tree, mode | root component handle |
| Registration | evaluated tree | detached root handle |
| Attachment | optional parent and child handles | unit |
| Query | selector, optional scope, cardinality | component handle(s) |
| Component method | handle, specification operation ID, arguments | value or unit |
| Handler registration | scope, specification signal ID, optional name, callback reference | unit |
| Engine API | specification operation ID, arguments | transport value or unit |
| Audio | specification operation ID and typed arguments | value or unit |
| Engine mutation | specification operation ID, targets, arguments | value or unit |
| Component inspection | handle and type/children/field operation | string, ordered handles, value, or missing-field marker |
| REPL inspection | world/component target and navigation operation | structured entries, target, description, or rendered source |

Pure evaluation uses `Hostless`, which returns a typed
`UnsupportedHostOperation` error for every host-effectful request.

The crate-owned `StandardHost` is distinct from a rejecting `Hostless`
implementation. It services component collection, opaque local handles, local
component inspection, attachment, and filesystem source loading. It returns
typed unsupported errors for operations that require an engine.

### Component sink adapter

Component construction requests form a useful generic sub-boundary. The crate
may expose a `ComponentSink` adapter for hosts that only need to accept emit,
register, and attach commands.

The adapter consumes crate-owned component trees and returns opaque component
handles or unit. A collecting sink stores emitted artifacts; a rejecting sink
provides pure evaluation; `MittensHost` constructs ECS trees. This adapter is
not a capability schema or runtime specification.

### REPL inspection

The crate's generic REPL navigates session-owned values inside the worker.
Live world/component navigation uses host inspection requests for:

- validation
- listing
- child resolution
- parent lookup
- descriptions/labels
- optional rendering or snapshotting as MMS source

Targets are `World`, an opaque session `ValueRef`, or an opaque
`ComponentHandle`; session-value requests do not cross to the host. Inspection
responses are structured DTOs rather than terminal-formatted lines.

This protocol does not declare MMS vocabulary and requires no
`RuntimeSpecBuilder`. A host may reject live inspection while the REPL
continues to support pure table, array, and component-artifact navigation.

### Universal component inspection

Language-level `node.type()`, `node.children()`, and `node.field` require no
host request for a static `ComponentExpr`: the session reads its own artifact.
For a live `ComponentObject`, the session issues generic inspection requests:

- read the component type name
- list immediate component children in host order
- read one authored named field

A confirmed missing field returns the protocol's missing-field result, which
the evaluator maps to `null`. Lack of inspection support is
`UnsupportedHostOperation`. Handle ownership and generation are checked first,
so `ForeignHandle` and `StaleHandle` remain distinguishable and are never
collapsed into missing or unsupported.

These inspection request shapes are universal protocol operations, not
registered component methods. `type()` and `children()` are reserved only for
component receivers; namesakes in authored component fields or tables do not
create host calls.

## Source loading

Import syntax and module evaluation belong to the crate. Access to
engine-relative files, assets, or URIs belongs to the host.

```rust
LoadSource {
    importer: Option<SourceId>,
    specifier: String,
}

SourceLoaded {
    resolved: SourceId,
    source: String,
}
```

`SourceId` is stable and host-neutral. The crate uses the resolved identity for
diagnostics, relative resolution of nested imports, and module caching.
Mittens may resolve that identity using a filesystem, asset database, or other
engine policy.

`StandardHost` canonicalizes filesystem paths before returning `SourceId`.
File entrypoints establish the initial canonical identity. A relative
specifier with no importer identity is a typed source-resolution failure; it
is never resolved against an ambient working directory. Canonical identities,
not spelling variants of paths, key the per-session module cache.

## Component lifecycle

### Register

Registration constructs a detached, uninitialized component subtree and
returns its root handle. The host:

- uses the construction/property bindings produced by the one `RuntimeSpec`
  builder
- applies already evaluated constructors, properties, and positionals
- constructs children without exposing ECS identifiers
- does not attach the root to a parent
- does not perform the final initialization walk

This gives MMS a live handle for method calls and queries before the subtree is
emitted.

### Attach

Attachment validates the parent and child handles, optionally adds the child
to the parent, and initializes the newly rooted subtree. A missing parent means
top-level attachment.

### Spawn/emit

A combined spawn/emit operation may construct and initialize a fresh tree in
one request. Existing component references embedded as children are opaque
handles and must be validated before splicing.

Re-emitting an already attached component remains governed by the component
emission policy; it is not permission to skip handle validation.

## Handle validation

Before every operation using a component, `MittensHost` checks:

1. ownership by the requesting session; and
2. that the complete generational ECS key still identifies a live component.

The first failure is `ForeignHandle`; the second is `StaleHandle`. Handle
conversion must preserve all generation bits.

## Specification-bound dispatch

Mittens constructs one crate-owned `RuntimeSpec` with the nested builder
described in
[Mittens host and MMS runtime boundary](mittens-host-and-runtime-boundary.md).
The same builder calls attach opaque host implementation bindings to every
host-effectful declaration. `Runtime` consumes the specification, while
`MittensHost` consumes those implementation bindings.

The binding table is not another specification: it contains no names,
signatures, aliases, signal schemas, or parser metadata.

The host must not:

- maintain an independent capability or vocabulary list
- use a blanket unsupported `CallApi` branch for registered APIs
- silently return success for unsupported REPL requests
- interpret AST expressions in the component registry

A request uses the opaque operation ID assigned when the single specification
was built. A name unknown to the configured runtime fails during validation
and must not become a host request. An operation whose current short-lived
host lacks a required service is unavailable in that context. A bound
dispatch function that fails returns a host failure with the operation and
engine cause preserved.

## Host lifetime

`MittensHost` borrows main-thread engine state only while servicing requests
for one runner operation. The MMS session does not own the host.

Host dispatch performs one specification-bound operation. It must not synchronously
re-enter the same session. Signals produced during dispatch enqueue callback
operations for later processing.

## Errors

At minimum, callers can distinguish:

- unsupported host operation
- unavailable host context
- invalid request
- foreign component handle
- stale component handle
- value/DTO conversion failure
- source resolution/loading failure
- host/engine failure
- protocol/correlation failure

Errors are returned as the correlated response and complete or fail the
originating MMS operation according to the worker protocol. They are not
encoded as `Null`, logged-only side effects, or no-op success.
