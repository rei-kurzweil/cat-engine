# AvatarControl — Spec

Date: 2026-03-23

## Goal

A single coordination point that rigs a humanoid avatar for first-person control from a
primary body/head driver (`InputComponent` or `InputXRComponent`) plus any number of
auxiliary pose drivers (`ControllerXRComponent` for hands, etc.) — without the
input-broadcast problem that causes body rotation when only the head should move.

---

## Design principle — route all drivers through AvatarControlComponent

> **Every transform driver that moves this avatar's bones must be a child of (or otherwise
> routed through) `AvatarControlComponent`.**

`AvatarControlSystem` uses this to:
1. Splice each driver into the correct point of the armature during init.
2. Create transform pipelines and IK chain components that shape each driver's pose
   before it reaches the armature.

### Body pipeline detail

```
TransformPipeline  (input = driven_t world matrix, via nearest TC ancestor)
  ForkTRS
    MapRotation
      QuatYawFollow { threshold: body_yaw_threshold, rate: body_yaw_rate }
        (state owned by TransformStreamSystem, keyed by stage path)
    MergeTRS  (translation + scale pass through unchanged)
  PipelineOutput
    model_root  (re-parented here; inherits shaped body yaw, no pitch/roll)
```

Stripping pitch and roll before `model_root` means the model Y offset (the negative camera-anchor height)
is only ever rotated by a pure-Y quaternion — feet cannot arc when looking up.

**No transform pipeline or AimConstraint for the head.** AVC creates a fixed
`head_mount` beneath `driven_t` and reparents the head bone beneath that mount.
It therefore inherits the input/HMD pose directly.

### Head IK detail

```
driven_t  (Input/InputXR-driven TC)
  head_mount  (fixed eye/head offset and forward-axis correction)
    J_Bip_C_Head  (displaced from the armature)
```

The mount inherits `driven_t` directly. `IKSystem` remains responsible for arm
TwoBoneIK and spine/body solving, but does not drive this head mount.

### Arm IK detail

```
J_Bip_L_UpperArm  (FK bone in skeleton)
  IKChain { TwoBoneIK }
    target_id:       left_ctrl driven_t    // controller world position = wrist target
    end_effector_id: J_Bip_L_Hand         // hand bone stays in FK skeleton (not displaced)
    pole_direction:  [0, -1, 0]           // world-space elbow hint (elbow-down default)
    copy_end_rot:    true                  // wrist rotation copied from controller
    weight:          1.0
  J_Bip_L_LowerArm
    J_Bip_L_Hand
```

`IKSystem` builds the chain as `[UpperArm, LowerArm, Hand]` (first TC child at each step,
then `end_effector_id` directly). Bone lengths are measured from FK world positions at tick
time (stable since only rotations are modified by IK). The controller stays under AVC —
`OpenXRSystem` correctly converts world→local regardless of parent hierarchy.

**Arm activation:** AVC consumes the owning GLTF's retained `HumanoidBoneMapReport`. A side is
enabled only when its upper-arm, lower-arm, and hand slots validate. The other side remains
independent. AVC does not perform name lookup or topology inference itself.

### Simple splice mode (no arm IK / fallback)

Used for non-controller/static hand routing after semantic map validation.

```
bone_original_parent  (e.g. J_Bip_L_LowerArm)
  ControllerXR (Left, Grip)
    controller_driven_t
      [sys] hand_pipeline  (TransformPipeline — only if hand_rotation_smoothing is Some)
        ForkTRS
          MapRotation
            QuatTemporalFilter { smoothing_factor }
          MergeTRS
        PipelineOutput
          [sys] smoothed_t  (TC)
            J_Bip_L_Hand  (displaced here)
      — OR, if smoothing is None —
      J_Bip_L_Hand  (displaced directly)
```

## Humanoid map and camera calibration

AVC requests the owning GLTF's retained `HumanoidBoneMapReport`. It waits until the required
head slot resolves before changing topology. An authored map overrides Auto inference; when no
map is authored, AVC requests an implicit Auto map. Each arm is enabled independently only when
its upper arm, lower arm, and hand resolve. Missing neck merely disables the neck rest pin.

For the resolved camera anchor:
1. On init, `model_root.y` is set from the anchor's rest/world height so the anchor sits at
   `driven_t`'s world Y.
2. Any `Camera3DComponent` or `CameraXRComponent` direct children of AVC are re-parented
   under the anchor so they inherit its world transform each tick.
3. `Camera3D` paths receive an extra local `Y = π` correction so the desktop render camera
   keeps the engine's `-Z` camera-forward convention while the visible head path preserves the
   authored avatar-facing basis. `CameraXR` does not receive this correction.

`avatar_height` overrides step 1 if set; step 2 still uses the resolved anchor. Resolution
prefers an explicit arbitrary transform, then a validated central eye/camera transform, then a
generated eye midpoint, and finally the head. A missing explicit selector remains diagnosed even
when a fallback keeps the camera operational.

---

## Shared vs Different

The runtime is now mostly shared across desktop and XR. The key distinction is:
the avatar/head topology and head-target convention are shared, while the primary pose
driver and final camera consumer are still different.

| Aspect | Shared between desktop and XR? | Desktop | XR |
|---|---|---|---|
| AVC init flow | Yes | Same `try_init_splices` path | Same `try_init_splices` path |
| Body pipeline topology | Yes | `body_pipeline -> model_root` | `body_pipeline -> model_root` |
| Visible head topology | Yes | `driven_t -> head_target -> head_bone` | `driven_t -> head_target -> head_bone` |
| Head-target convention | Yes | Shared XR-style default | Shared XR-style default |
| Default `head_target` yaw / head IK offset yaw | Yes | `π` | `π` |
| Head bone restore after reparent | Yes | restore authored `head_rest_rot`, zero translation, preserve scale | same |
| Camera-anchor auto-calibration | Yes | same `model_root.y` calibration from the resolved anchor | same |
| Camera discovery by topology | Yes | direct AVC camera child discovered and re-parented | same |
| Camera anchor parent | Yes | same mapped/generated anchor | same mapped/generated anchor |
| Primary pose driver | No | `InputComponent` | `InputXRComponent` |
| Hand/controller drivers | No | usually none | optional `ControllerXRComponent` children |
| Body-yaw authored override support | Yes | supported | supported |
| Default body-yaw convention | Yes | `forward_plus_z = false`, `initial_body_yaw = π` | `forward_plus_z = false`, `initial_body_yaw = π` |
| Final render camera component | No | `Camera3DComponent` | `CameraXRComponent` |
| Extra camera local yaw correction | No | local `Y = π` applied to `Camera3D` path | none |

### Practical reading of the table

What is the same:
- The avatar rigging topology created by AVC.
- The head-target math and authored eye-offset sign convention.
- The way the visible head bone is restored and mounted.
- The mapped camera-anchor calibration and camera discovery/reparent flow.

What is not the same:
- Desktop is driven by `InputComponent`; XR is driven by `InputXRComponent`.
- XR may also include controller/hand drivers.
- Desktop `Camera3D` gets a final local yaw correction because it consumes the parent
  transform directly as a mono render camera, while XR view matrices come from OpenXR's
  eye poses rather than from the `CameraXR` parent transform alone.

## AvatarControlSystem responsibilities

### Init phase (event-backed lazy handoff)

1. Find `model_root` and request the first skinned GLTF's retained humanoid report.
2. Wait without topology mutation until the mapped head validates.
3. Create `head_mount` beneath `driven_t`; displace the mapped head beneath it.
4. Create body pipeline as child of AVC; re-parent `model_root` under its output.
5. Independently create each arm IK chain whose mapped upper arm, lower arm, and hand validate.
6. Calibrate and attach cameras to the report's operational `camera_anchor` target.
7. Store all runtime IDs on `AvatarControlComponent`; `head_mount` being `Some` stops retries.

### Tick (after init)

`AvatarControlSystem::tick` only re-attempts init until `head_mount` is live.
All per-frame pose work is handled by:
- `TransformStreamSystem` — body pipeline (yaw follow) + hand smoothing pipeline
- `IKSystem` — arm TwoBoneIK and spine/body solving

---

## Resolved (see [ik-system.md](ik-system.md) for details)

1. **Pole direction body-local space** — world-space pole breaks when body rotates.
   `IKChainComponent` now has a `pub(crate) avc_id` field; when an ancestor AVC is found,
   the solver rotates the pole by the model root world rotation each tick.  Non-AVC
   `TwoBoneIK` chains keep world-space behaviour.

2. **Side-specific pole directions** — defaults are now semantically body-local:
   `[-1, 0, -1]` for left, `[1, 0, -1]` for right.  The solver transforms them to world
   space each tick, so the mirroring stays correct even as the body turns.

## Open questions / future work
   only applies to simple splice. Add `QuatTemporalFilter` on end-effector rotation.

4. **Spine IK** — FABRIK chain from hips to neck driven by head offset from body.
   Requires `TranslationFollow` pipeline op first (body XZ lags head XZ).

5. **Convention presets** — MMS factories under `assets/components/humanoid_bone_maps/`
   provide shared VRoid naming and discoverable Bisket/PC-Rei presets.
