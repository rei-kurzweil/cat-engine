# Avatar camera anchoring

Date: 2026-08-06

Avatar cameras are attached through the owning GLTF's `HumanoidBoneMapReport`; AVC has no camera
or head bone-name fields.

Resolution order is:

1. an explicit `camera_anchor` selector resolving uniquely to any `Transform`;
2. one semantically named central camera/eye anchor validated below the mapped head;
3. a retained generated transform at the mapped eye midpoint below the head;
4. the mapped head, with AVC's authored eye-height offset available as an expert fallback.

A missing or ambiguous explicit camera selector remains in report diagnostics even when a fallback
keeps the camera operational. Relevant attachment or GLTF lifecycle events produce a new map
generation; AVC switches to the new retained target without polling the skeleton each frame.

Direct `Camera3DComponent` and `CameraXRComponent` children of AVC, including camera components
wrapped by one transform carrying an authored eye offset, are reparented beneath the operational
anchor during initialization. Model-root height calibration uses immutable GLTF rest poses, never
an animation-mutated live pose.

XR view matrices continue to come from OpenXR eye poses. The mapped anchor aligns avatar anatomy
and camera topology; it does not replace the runtime's stereoscopic view calculation.
